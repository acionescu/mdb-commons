Concept:

All the changes made by the current user of the schema will be saved into a special structure, in such a way
that will allow later recovery of those changes
Changes will occur at different granularities such as: schema, table and row
Changes need to be saved for each granularity if the current granularity supports versioning
So we need to keep track of the last transaction for the schema, table and row 





Management: 

-each transaction has an unique id
-the unique ids will be provided by a sequence managed by the SchemaMetadataManager
-when a change occurs, a new transaction id is stored for the schema, the table and the row on which
the change occured
